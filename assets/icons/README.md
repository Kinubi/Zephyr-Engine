Place small (e.g. 16x16 or 64x64) PNG icons in this directory to override UI icons.
Naming convention (optional, used by asset browser):
- folder.png          -> icon for directories
- png.png, jpg.png    -> icons for file extensions (without leading dot)
- model.png           -> generic model icon, etc.

If no icon file is found for an entry type, the asset browser will fall back to generated colored icons.
